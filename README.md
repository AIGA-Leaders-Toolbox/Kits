Welcome to the AIGA-Leads-Toolbox wiki! If you're here, it's because you're a chapter leader who wants to share your ideas and your successes with other AIGA chapter leadership.

The goal of this git is to collect and share projects, programming, tools and templates with the group. To participate, you must agree to abide by AIGA's Code of Conduct.

Additionally:

    Do not delete other people's contributions.
    Feel free to add comments to contributions. Keep them kind and constructive. No negative criticism, only positive critique.
    Do not add products (we're keeping this simple).

Down the road, if the national organization creates a repository within the existing AIGA digital ecosystem, this git will be retired, and this content will be ported over.

To get started, hop over to the Wiki - where all contributions will be stored.

Let us know if you have any questions! We're in the Leadership Slack. Frances + Victor
